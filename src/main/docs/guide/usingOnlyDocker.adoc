There is another option that does not requires the usage of a Gradle plugin. With this approach we can just use _plain Docker_
to build a Docker image and start a container.

== Defining the Docker file

Create the following `Dockerfile`:

[source, Dockerfile]
.src/main/docker/Dockerfile
----
FROM postgres:9.6.6 # <1>

VOLUME /var/lib/postgresql/data # <2>

COPY ["setup.sh", "/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/"] # <3>

EXPOSE 5432 # <4>
----
<1> Use the same PostgreSQL image and version as before
<2> Define a volume to store the data
<3> Copy a script to the entrypoint directory. Any `.sh` or `.sql` file in this directory will be executing when starting the container
<4> Expose the port

Also create the file `setup.sh`:

[source, bash]
.src/main/docker/setup.sh
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/docker/setup.sh[]
----
<1> Create the database, user and password for development environment
<2> Define another database, user and password for the test environment


== Building the image

With those files created, let's build the docker image:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker build -t demo-postgres src/main/docker/
----

== Start a container

To create and start a container for the first time based on the image we have just created:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgres demo-postgres
----

From now on, every time we want to start/stop the container, we only need to execute:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker start postgres

$ docker stop postgres
----

TIP: Keep in mind that you also need to change `application.yml` to use the new credentials defined in `setup.sh` file.

Replace the database development environment configuration with:

[source, yaml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
environments:
    development:
        dataSource:
            dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
            driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
            username: dev_user
            password: dev_password
            dbCreate: update
            url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dev_demo_db
----
